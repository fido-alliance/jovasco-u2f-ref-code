A number of U2F BLE conformance tests:

	- BLE Transport tests
	- U2F Raw Message tests.
	- Limited ADPU encoding tests


To build these tests you will need:

	git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core
	Windows Platform SDK

Supported platforms:
	Windows 8


Building for Windows:
	nmake -f Makefile.win


IMPORTANT:
	Windows does NOT support resolvable private addresses.


Usage

By default the test will select the first U2F device reported by Windows.
You can list the available devices as follows:

	BLETest -l

Which will return the device Identifiers of the available FIDO BLE devices.
You can then run the test on a specific device by doing:

	BLETest -d "<device identifier>"

Full usage:

Usage: BLETest [-d <device-identifier>] [-l] [-h] [-a] [-v] [-V] [-p] [-e] [-u] [-t] [-w] [-i] [-c] [-x]
  -h : this text.
  -a : Do not abort on failed test.
  -v : Verbose
  -V : Even more verbose
  -p : Pause at failed test
  -e : Device does preapproval when turned on
  -u : Disable U2F Raw Message tests.
  -t : Disable BLE Transport tests.
  -i : Enable U2F ISO7816-4 encoding tests.
  -w : Warnings are treated as errors.
  -x : Disable encrypted connection requirement.
  -c : Toggle ANSI colors.
  -l : Show all known FIDO BLE devices and exit.
  -d : Select specific FIDO BLE device.



Compatible hardware:

All testing has been performed with a CSR8510 A10 based dongle.
